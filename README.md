# Lotus 58
This repository contains the required files for the setting up of the Lotus 58 keyboard.

To replicate the process, you'll need to do the following steps:
1. Download the QMK Toolbox from the Github page. I have a linux machine which is not powerful enough for a VM, so I had it configured on a friend's machine. There is an option to do it through the command line utility. But wasn't sure and I didn't use that method. Maybe in the next iteration I will use that method.
2. If it is Windows, you'll have to install the drivers.
3. Restart the machine.
4. In the Local File, insert the path for the HEX file (???) or the JSON file (???)
5. My MCU will be atmega32u4. Checked this on QMK_firmware for lily58
6. Reset the keyboard?! How did you do it?! Using the Space+B and Esc? Or the physical one?!
7. Then press Flash on the QMK Toolbox
